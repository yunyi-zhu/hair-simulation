Q: Compile and Run?
A: this is compiled on my mac
$ cd build
$ ./a3 r|e|t [stepsize] (0.01 for r)
mac executable a3 in build directory

To reset: press "R"
To turn on/off a breeze: press "B" (applies to cloth only, not other particles)
To turn on/off smooth shading: press "S"
To turn on/off wireframe: press "W" (applies to both cloth and particles)
To move the cloth: press up/down/left/right keys on keyboard, moves one unit length of the grid each time

My particle system takes in random values for initial state, so it might look a bit different after each reset.

Q: Collaboration
A: N/A individual

Q: References
A: Lecture slides

Q: Know problems?
A: My particle system takes in random values for initial state, so it might look a bit different after each reset. I think this is allowed though?

Q: Extra Credit?
A: I did first and second part in the Easy category, and also added the ability to move the cloth with up/down/left/right keys on keyboard. I included some screenshots in the folder.

Note that the breeze is set to blow in the negative z-direction, so the cloth will not move forward.

To turn on/off wind force: press key "B"
To turn on smooth shading: press "S"
Use up/down/left/right keys to move the position of the cloth.
